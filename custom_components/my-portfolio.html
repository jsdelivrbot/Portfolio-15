			<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001" target="_blank">
				Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree
			</a>
		where I used my new HTML, CSS and responsive web design skills to build a portfolio to show
		the other projects I would build during this nanodgree. Now that the nanodegree is complete,
		looking back at my code and it's really messy and there's things to do to improve it with
		the new skills I've learned. To demonstrate that I'm not afraid of learning new frameworks
		and change my way of thinking, I started to learn
			<a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/" target="_blank">
				Polymer Components
			</a>
		and rebuilts this portfolio using it. My code for this portfolio can be found
			<a href="https://github.com/ncaron/Portfolio" target="_blank">
				here
			</a>
		and the code for the old version can be found
