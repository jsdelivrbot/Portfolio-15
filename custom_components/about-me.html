			<p>I'm from a small town in East Canada and since childhood, I've always had a
			passion for electronics and problem solving. Taking computers apart and logic
			puzzles were my hobbies which led me to programming after enrolling in computer
			engineering at the University of Ottawa. That's also when I realized that traditional
			education was not for me. I learn faster and more efficiently on my own. After
			leaving the program, I focused on my own education, taking online courses such
			as calculus, physics, linear algebra, etc. I have completed Udacity's
			Front End Web Developer Nanodegree where I built 5 portfolio worthy projects
			and I'm currently working towards completing their Senior Web Developer Nanodegree.</p>
